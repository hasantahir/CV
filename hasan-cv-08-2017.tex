%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Document Setup %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Don't like 10pt? Try 11pt or 12pt
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}

% LaTeX will typeset using Computer Modern Roman, which a lot of
% non-mathematicians and non-engineers won't like. Also, a few PDF
% viewers may not render CMR very well. Instead, Times New Roman can
% be used. That's what this package does.
\usepackage{mathptmx}

% The automated optical recognition software used to digitize resume
% information works best with fonts that do not have serifs. This
% command uses a sans serif font throughout. Uncomment both lines (or at
% least the second) to restore a Roman font (i.e., a font with serifs).
% (NOTE: This requires the times package above)
%\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}

% This is a helpful package that puts math inside length specifications
\usepackage{calc}

% This package helps LaTeX auto-hyphenate hyphenated words if you use
% special hyphens. For example, bio\-/mimicry will properly hyphenate
% ``mimicry'' if necessary.
\usepackage[shortcuts]{extdash}

% Layout: Puts the section titles on left side of page
\reversemarginpar

%
%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.
%

%            includemp]{geometry}

%% More layout: Get rid of indenting throughout entire document
\setlength{\parindent}{0in}

% Provides special list environments and macros to create new ones
\usepackage[shortlabels]{enumitem}

% Simpler bibsections for CV sections
% (thanks to natbib for inspiration)

%
% * For numbered lists of references (with hanging indents):
%
%   \begin{bibenum}
%       \item ...
%   \end{bibenum}
%
%   Note that bibenum numbers continuously throughout. To reset the

%%% HEADING AT TOP OF CURRICULUM VITAE

% The title (name) with a horizontal rule under it
% (optional argument typesets an object right-justified across from name
%  as well)
%
% Usage: \makeheading{name}
%        OR
%        \makeheading[right_object]{name}
%
% Place at top of document. It should be the first thing.
% If ``right_object'' is provided in the square-braced optional
% argument, it will be right justified on the same line as ``name'' at
% the top of the CV. For example:
%
%       \makeheading[\emph{Curriculum vitae}]{Your Name}
%
% will put an emphasized ``Curriculum vitae'' at the top of the document
% as a title. Likewise, a picture could be included:
%
%   \makeheading[{\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{my_picture}}]{Your Name}
%
% the picture will be flush right across from the name. For this example
% to work, make sure the extra set of curly braces is included. Also
% makes ure that \usepackage{graphicx} is somewhere in the preamble.
